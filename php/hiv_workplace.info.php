<p>The  Ministry of Water and Housing and the Ministry of Transport and Works has  joined in the nationwide effort to raise awareness about the HIV/AIDS pandemic  and to promote the concept of healthy lifestyles to their staff and clients. To  this end, Health Corners were opened at both Ministries on June 5 and July 18 ,  2008 respectively, with the aim of reinforcing the implementation of the  HIV/AIDS Workplace Policy.<br />
  The Policy seeks to facilitate the  development of a working environment that protects the rights of workers  infected and/or affected by the epidemic through the development of a framework  for action in the workplace. It  highlights the rights and responsibilities of workers and emphasizes the need  for education, training an improved awareness, counseling, care and support in  prevention and treatment.<br />
  <br />
  It applies to all workers, including  prospective workers in the public and private sectors, all workplaces and all  employers  in the public and private  sectors.</p>
<p>But  the Health Corners contain more than just information about HIV/AIDS. They also endorse a holistic approach to a healthy  lifestyle to which all individuals can adhere.   As such, printed materials including flyers, brochures, posters and  other handouts containing information on HIV/AIDS and other related health  matters have been provided by the Ministry of Health and related entities, at  the display booths for on-the-spot reading and collection..</p>
<p>Condoms  are also available to employees at the display booths which are strategically and  conveniently located at the entrance/exit to the floors and the lobby areas of  the Ministry’s buildings, and serve as a reminder to employees at the end of  the work day to &quot;wrap it up&quot;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggestion  boxes have also been made available in each Health Corner in which employees  are invited to make comments on how the intervention strategies can be improved. </p>
It is expected that The HIV/AIDS Workplace  Programme will continue to open Health Corners in the Agencies of these  Ministries throughout 2008/2009.
