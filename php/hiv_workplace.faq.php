<a name="heading1" id="heading1"></a><strong>1. What are HIV &amp; AIDS? </strong><br />
<br />
<p>Human  Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is the virus that causes AIDS (Acquired  Immune Deficiency Syndrome). Being HIV-positive or having HIV disease  is not the same as having AIDS. Many people are diagnosed with HIV but  may not get sick for many years. Once in a person&rsquo;s system, HIV begins  to attack the immune system and for many who are HIV-positive, over a  period of time, they can become ill with a number of conditions. </p>
<p> AIDS is a technical term defined by the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention. An HIV-positive person is diagnosed with AIDS when that  person has developed certain opportunistic infections or other medical  conditions such as a T-cell or CD4 (the most basic element of the  immune system) count of less than 200. Only a physician can officially  make the diagnosis that a person with HIV now has &ldquo;AIDS&rdquo;. Generally an  AIDS diagnosis occurs many years after infection. </p>
<p> HIV  is the virus, AIDS is the disease and &ldquo;HIV disease&rdquo; is the most  appropriate way to describe the continuum of HIV to AIDS. It is  important to note that an AIDS diagnosis does not mean that an  individual will soon die. While severe illness can develop, there are  many medications available to help treat these. With good medical care  it is possible for a person to maintain good health even after an AIDS  diagnosis. </p>

<p><strong><a name="heading2" id="heading2"></a>2. Do I need to get tested? Where can I get tested? </strong></p>
<p> Transmission of HIV almost always occurs through unprotected anal or  vaginal sex, or by sharing needles. If people think they have been  exposed to the HIV virus they should get an HIV test. Explore the other  questions on this page to help assess if you are at risk for HIV or  contact the Minnesota AIDS Project (MAP) AIDSLine and a community  educator will assess your risk.</p>
<p>The most commonly used  test is a blood test that looks for antibodies to the virus. Antibodies  are produced by the immune system to fight the virus. The &ldquo;window  period&rdquo; is the time that it takes for the antibodies to develop after  being exposed. Although many people develop antibodies within the first  month of their infection, some people take a bit longer. Clinicians  agree that testing at three months after exposure will give a  conclusive result. All pregnant women should be tested for HIV so they  can be treated prenatally and greatly reduce the risk of transmitting  HIV to their baby.</p>
<p>People can get tested for HIV by their  regular doctor, or they can go to a community clinic, a public health  clinic, or a clinic that specializes in sexual health such as Planned  Parenthood. There is now a rapid blood test for HIV that requires only  a few drops of blood and gives same day results. It is especially  important to practice abstinence or safe sex and to avoid sharing  needles during the window period in order to get an accurate HIV test  result, and to avoid the risk of infecting another person since newly  infected people are especially infectious to others. </p>

<p><strong> <a name="heading3" id="heading3"></a>3. Where did HIV come from?</strong></p>
<p> Since scientists first became aware of HIV in the early 1980s, they  have explored and debated how and where the disease originated. To this  day, the debate continues and different theories exist. Despite these  differing theories, all the experts still agree that&nbsp;HIV is&nbsp;the  virus&nbsp;that&nbsp;weakens a person's immune system and can lead to&nbsp;either one  or more physical conditions that a physician then&nbsp;diagnoses as &quot;AIDS&quot;.&nbsp; </p>
<p> In February of 1999, an international team of  scientists reported that they had traced the roots of the most common  type of HIV (HIV-1) to a virus found in a subspecies of chimpanzees in  Africa. It is now generally accepted that HIV is a descendant of this  virus. It is believed that the virus was transferred to humans as a  result of chimpanzees being killed and eaten or their blood getting  into cuts or wounds of people during the hunting process . </p>
<p> While determining the origin of HIV was important to increase  understanding of the virus, it is important to now focus on treatments  for people living with HIV and education and prevention efforts to stop  the spread of HIV. </p>

<hr class="dotted_light"/>
<p><strong> <a name="heading4" id="heading4"></a>4. Is there a cure for HIV? </strong></p>
<p> There is no cure for HIV yet, but research continues daily. There are a  variety of medications that can slow down the progression from HIV to  AIDS and reduce damage to the immune system. Many of these drugs were  not available until the mid-to-late 1990&rsquo;s. Other drugs can prevent or  treat opportunistic infections that result from HIV infection. </p>

<hr class="dotted_light"/>
<p><strong> <a name="heading5" id="heading5"></a>5.&nbsp; What is the difference between HIV-1 and HIV-2? </strong></p>
<p> There are two identified strains of HIV:&nbsp; HIV-1 is the retrovirus  usually associated with the epidemic in most of the world, including  the United States; HIV-2 is not as virulent as HIV-1 and is primarily  epidemic in West Africa.&nbsp; Many HIV tests in the United States will  detect either HIV-1 or HIV-2.&nbsp; Blood banks and plasma centers also  screen for HIV-1 and HIV-2. </p>
<p> Due to the rare incidence  of HIV-2 in the United States, testing for this specific strain of HIV  is only recommended if a person has had a known risk with someone from  a country where HIV-2 is prevalent. </p>

<hr class="dotted_light"/>
<p><strong> <a name="heading6" id="heading6"></a>6. How is HIV transmitted? </strong></p>
<p> A person must be infected with HIV in order to infect others. There are  no uninfected &ldquo;carriers&rdquo; of the disease. The virus is transmitted only  by the blood, semen, vaginal fluid or breast milk of an HIV-infected  person. It is not transmitted by sweat, tears, urine, saliva or casual  contact. In order for transmission to occur, the virus must enter an  uninfected person&rsquo;s bloodstream. The virus can enter the bloodstream  through contact with mucus membranes or through open cuts or by  injection. Transmission almost always occurs through unprotected anal  or vaginal sex (mucous membranes), or by sharing needles. In very rare  cases, HIV transmission has occurred through oral sex. HIV can be  transmitted from an HIV-positive woman to an infant through breast  milk. It should be noted that HIV is not very concentrated in breast  milk and it is only through repeated feedings of large quantities of  breast milk that transmission may occur. </p>
<p> Transmission  is most likely when a person is exposed to high concentrations of the  virus. When a person is newly infected with HIV, the virus multiplies  very rapidly within that person. A newly infected person is especially  infectious to others in the first few weeks and months immediately  following infection. This is why anyone who has had a risk of HIV  infection should be especially careful to practice abstinence or safe  sex or not share needles until they get a definitive HIV test. </p>

<hr class="dotted_light"/>
<p><strong> <a name="heading7" id="heading7"></a>7.&nbsp; Can I get HIV from casual contact? </strong></p>
<p> No, HIV is a fragile virus and dies within seconds when exposed to  light and air (oxygen). Therefore HIV can only be transmitted when an  HIV-negative person comes into contact with one of these four bodily  fluids: blood, semen, vaginal fluid or breast milk.&nbsp; HIV is most often  transmitted through unprotected sex and sharing needles.&nbsp; HIV can NOT  be transmitted from hugging, kissing, shaking hands, sharing towels,  sharing eating utensils, swimming in public pools, or using public  restrooms.&nbsp; </p>

<hr class="dotted_light"/>
<p><strong> <a name="heading8" id="heading8"></a>8. Is the blood supply safe?</strong></p>
<p> Yes. The blood supply in the U.S. is one of the safest in the world.  Since 1985, all blood in the U.S. has been tested for HIV, hepatitis  and other infectious agents. Even in high prevalence areas where many  people with HIV live, the risk of transmission through a blood or blood  produced transfusion is infinitesimal. </p>

<hr class="dotted_light"/>
<p><strong> <a name="heading9" id="heading9"></a>9. Can mosquitoes transmit HIV? </strong></p>
<p> No. Numerous studies by the CDC and other programs have shown no  evidence of HIV transmission through mosquitoes. These studies showed  that transmission via mosquitoes is not possible because: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Mosquitoes do not ingest enough HIV-infected blood to transmit HIV to  another person. The small amount of the virus ingested by mosquitoes is  not substantial enough to cause HIV infection in another person. </li>
  <li> Mosquitoes digest HIV. The virus cannot survive inside the insect and it cannot be passed on to the mosquito&rsquo;s next host. </li>
  <li> Mosquitoes are not flying hypodermic needles. A mosquito&rsquo;s complex  feeding apparatus does not involve any exchange of blood between the  mosquito and host. </li>
</ul>

<hr class="dotted_light"/>
<p><strong><a name="heading10" id="heading10"></a>10. Can I get HIV from my doctor or dentist?</strong><br />
    <br />
  In the U.S., there has only been one documented case of HIV  transmission from a health care provider to a patient. This case was  reported in 1989 and involved a Florida dentist and the controversy  about its reliability continues. <br />
  <br />
  Health care workers are mandated by federal law to follow certain  infection control guidelines to prevent infections from being passed  from health care worker to patient and from patient to health care  worker. <br />
  <br />
  In Minnesota, HIV-positive health care workers must report themselves  to the state, and can continue practicing only by adhering to certain  safety restrictions and oversight. <br />

<hr class="dotted_light"/>
<p><strong> <a name="heading11" id="heading11"></a>11. </strong><strong> Are condoms effective in preventing HIV transmission? </strong></p>
<p> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) state that correct  and consistent use of a latex barrier for protection during sex greatly  reduces the risk of transmitting HIV. Condoms can protect the mouth,  vagina or rectum from HIV-infected semen. Male condoms protect the  penis from HIV-infected vaginal fluids and blood in the mouth, vagina,  or rectum. Female condoms can be inserted into the vagina or rectum to  prevent HIV transmission. They also reduce the risk of spreading other  sexually transmitted diseases. </p>
<p> Latex is the most  common material for condoms. Viruses cannot get through it. Never use  oil-based lubricants like Vasoline, salad oil or hand or body lotion.  These can cause tears and leaks in the latex causing it to break.  Instead, use a water-based lubricant such as K-Y Jelly. Polyurethane is  an option for people who are allergic to latex. Lambskin or natural  condoms have pores small enough for HIV to pass through; they do NOT  prevent the spread of HIV. </p>
<p> Condoms must be stored,  used and disposed of correctly. Also, observe the expiration date on  the package and tear it open carefully. Avoid opening by tearing the  package with your teeth or using a scissors as tiny cuts may be made in  the condom. Never use a product that has been previously used or  exposed to extreme temperatures. </p>
<p> Nonoxynol-9 is a  chemical that kills sperm and is used in the vagina along with condoms  or other birth control methods to help prevent pregnancy. It should not  be used as a way to prevent HIV infection because many people are  allergic to it. For some, their sexual organs can become irritated from  Nonoxynol-9 and develop small sores that actually make it easier for  HIV, if present in the other partner, to enter their system. </p>

<hr class="dotted_light"/>
<p><strong><a name="heading12" id="heading12"></a>12.&nbsp; Is abstinence the only way to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV? </strong></p>
<p>Abstaining  from sexual activity with others can eliminate the risk of becoming  infected with HIV. Be aware that using drugs or alcohol can impair  judgment and make it difficult to maintain abstinence or ultimately  practice safer sex.&nbsp;Learn about sexual activities that can reduce the  risk of HIV transmission by avoiding exposure to semen or vaginal  fluid.&nbsp;For many abstinence is a practical and useful choice, however  for others it is not an option so learning about the correct and  consistent usage of condoms and latex barriers during sex greatly  reduces the risk of contracting HIV.</p>
<p>Even for those who  have chosen abstinence as their prevention technique, at some point  most adults will enter into a sexual relationship with someone else,  thus learning about safer sex <em>prior</em> to that encounter will aid in understanding how to remain HIV-free.</p>

<hr class="dotted_light"/>
<p><strong> <a name="heading13" id="heading13"></a>13. Can I get HIV from unprotected oral sex? </strong></p>
<p> There have been very few documented cases of transmission through solely oral sex thus the risk is extremely low. </p>
<p> HIV is not transmitted through saliva. Sexual transmission of HIV  requires the presence of HIV infected blood, semen or vaginal fluid.  The risk of transmission is increased by the presence of open cuts or  sores in the mouth or on the genitals. Having other sexually  transmitted diseases (STDs) can also increase the risk of HIV  transmission. Specifically, the sores associated with syphilis and  herpes can assist with HIV transmission. </p>
<p> Reduce the risk of HIV during oral sex by using a latex or polyurethane barrier such as a condom or dental dam. </p>
<p> It is important to remember that some other STDs, unlike HIV, can be  easily transmitted during oral sex. The barriers above can also reduce  this risk. </p>

<hr class="dotted_light"/>
<p><strong><a name="heading14" id="heading14"></a>14.&nbsp; What if I have another Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD)? </strong></p>
<p>Research  has shown that HIV transmission is 2-5 times more likely to occur when  another sexually transmitted disease is present.&nbsp; If the STD causes  sores or irritation in the skin it can be easier for HIV to enter the  body.&nbsp; Even if the STD does not cause open sores or irritation it can  stimulate an immune response that can make HIV transmission more  likely.&nbsp; Most STDs can be detected by testing within a few weeks after  exposure, and many are treatable or curable.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<hr class="dotted_light"/>
<p><strong><a name="heading15" id="heading15"></a>15. How is HIV transmitted through injecting drug use? </strong></p>
<p>Sharing  needles is a high risk behavior for HIV since a contaminated syringe  can pass blood directly from one person&rsquo;s bloodstream to another. Blood  can enter a syringe when it is placed into the vein. Some of this blood  remains in the syringe after use and can enter to bloodstream of others  if the needle is shared. Sharing needles is also a high risk for  hepatitis transmission.</p>
<p>An injection drug user who has  never shared syringes or other drug paraphernalia cannot become  infected with HIV from clean (sterile) syringes regardless of his or  her drug use. The exchange of blood from sharing contaminated syringes  causes transmission, not the drug use itself.</p>

<hr class="dotted_light"/>
<p><strong><a name="heading16" id="heading16"></a>16. How can the risk of HIV infection from injecting drug use be reduced? </strong></p>
<p>Injecting  drug users can reduce HIV transmission by not sharing syringes or any  other injection supplies. Sharing needles with anyone is a risk for HIV  and other blood-borne diseases. People who inject drugs should use  their own &ldquo;works&rdquo; to best protect themselves against potential exposure  to HIV. Using a sterile syringe significantly reduces the risk of  contracting HIV and hepatitis.</p>

<hr class="dotted_light"/>
<p><strong><a name="heading17" id="heading17"></a>17. Are clean syringes available in Jamaica? </strong></p>
<p>Clean  syringes can be purchased in quantities of ten or fewer from pharmacies  throughout the island.</p>

<hr class="dotted_light"/>
<p><strong><a name="heading18" id="heading18"></a>18. We all know how HIV is spread, so why continue to spend money on prevention? </strong></p>
<p>HIV  is like many other social and public health issues involving behavior,  such as smoking, eating health foods, seatbelt use and speeding; people  need to be continually reminded. HIV prevention education doesn&rsquo;t  always reach those who need the information and for many young people,  they may only receive the information once while in high school. Later  in life they may have many questions and that&rsquo;s why we need to make  sure the message of HIV transmission is broadly placed. HIV has  impacted certain communities disproportionately due to ongoing stigma  and fear. Focused prevention efforts can help to engage these  communities to slow the spread of HIV.</p>
<p>As of the end of  2007, 5,950 people were known to be living with HIV in Minnesota. There  are several thousand others who are also HIV-positive, but have not  been tested and thus don&rsquo;t know their status. Advances in treatment  have allowed people with HIV to live longer, more healthy lives. That  also means that there is a growing percentage of the population which  is living with HIV. This trend will continue as long as there is not a  viable vaccine for HIV. </p>
<p>HIV is a preventable disease  but, to achieve this, everyone needs complete, accurate information in  order to reduce their risk surrounding HIV. Ongoing, age-appropriate  education is necessary to raise awareness in the public and reduce new  infections.</p>
